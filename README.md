# The Job Space - Job Searching Made Easy

## About
This is a project that aims to process various job search feeds/APIs and display retrieved job postings in an easy-to-navigate manner.

I plan to store feed/API urls in a database, via a Laravel-based admin backend. To display job postings, I plan to create an API
which will combine listings from all feeds, then display them via the use of BackboneJS. Initially, I plan for job search listings 
to be sortable by: title, date posted, location, proximity to location, keywords, and the feed vendor - more will be added later on.
I plan to use Bootstrap for front-end look-and-feel - I am not a designer by trade, so will be aiming for the 'simple is best' approach.

I know the niche-market for such sites is over-saturated; however, this is more of a project to build upon my personal experience.

## Contributing

below: 

* Fork the repository.

If you spot mistakes in my code, please by all means let me know. I'm always wanting to improve my code, so collaboration is very welcome.

## Quality of Code

### Commenting
To help other potential contributors (as well as myself) understand what you have contributed, please comment your code. 
Suggested examples can be viewed at http://www.phpdoc.org/docs/latest/getting-started/your-first-set-of-documentation.html.

### PHP Coding Standards
As I want to increase the quality of my code, I plan to use relevant PHP coding standards from http://www.php-fig.org/psr/ (at least up to PSR4).

### Software Design Principles
I also will do my best to adhere to relevant software design principles - a good reference for these is http://www.oodesign.com/design-principles.html. 
Some good examples of software design principles, in PHP, can be seen at http://code.tutsplus.com/series/the-solid-principles--cms-634.

### Software Design Patterns
Where appropriate, I also plan to enhance code quality by making the most out of Object-Oriented Design Patterns. Some excellent examples can 
be found at https://github.com/domnikl/DesignPatternsPHP. 

### Testing

#### PHP Code Base
For testing PHP classes, functions, code logic, etc, I plan to use PHPUnit. If you don't know what PHPUnit is, you can visit the vendor website 
at https://phpunit.de/ - examples of it's use in Laravel 5+ can be seen at https://laraveltips.wordpress.com/category/phpunit-testing-in-laravel-5-1/.

#### BackboneJS
I am still relatively new to BackboneJS, so using tests here will make life a whole lot easier. I plan to look over the following guides:

* http://www.sitepoint.com/unit-testing-backbone-js-applications/
* http://mdcox.net/posts/backbone-unit-testing.html

#### JQuery/Vanilla Javascript
Up until now, I haven't seriously considered unit testing any of my Javascript/JQuery code (probably because my speciality is back-end server-side code). 
That is a bad thing on my part, so I plan on starting now. Upon a quick glance, QUnit (http://qunitjs.com/) provides an excellent framework for testing - 
some excellent examples can be directly accessed at http://qunitjs.com/intro/. The 'Intro' section is comprehensive, so will be looked upon very often.
